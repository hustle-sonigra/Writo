Writo is a backend-driven blogging platform built to practice real-world concepts like authentication middleware, MVC architecture, and database relationships.

## Why Writo❔
This project was built to understand:

* How JWT authentication works end-to-end

* How middleware protects routes

* How data flows in an MVC-based Express app

* How MongoDB relations (users ↔ posts ↔ likes) are handled
  
* Curiosity led project to execute and understand 
---

## 🚀 Features

* User authentication using JWT and tokens
* Create, edit, and delete blog posts
* Liking system with real-time count and updations
* Search blogs by keyword
* Filtered result via regex, in-memory, or MongoDB text-index search, selectable with `SEARCH_MODE`
* Role-based access (only authors can edit their posts) , proper Authorisation
* Responsive and minimal UI 

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Frontend:** EJS, CSS
* **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)
* **Authentication:** JWT, Middleware
* **Deployment:** Render

## 🧠 Application Flow

1. User signs up / logs in
2. JWT is issued
3. Verification via middleware
4. Allotment of a token to remember the User
5. Authenticated users can create and manage posts
6. Posts are stored in MongoDB and rendered via EJS
7. Likes are also stores in the database
8. Search filters posts efficiently on request
9. Responsive feed displaying all the posts uploaded
10. Reading and liking of each post can be also  done

## ⚙️ Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hustle-sonigra/Writo
cd Writo
npm install
npm start
```

Create a `.env` file and add:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_url
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
SEARCH_MODE=regex   # optional — regex (default) | text | memory
```

`SEARCH_MODE` picks the strategy behind blog search: `regex` runs a case-insensitive
`$or` match, `text` uses the MongoDB text index declared on `Post`, and `memory`
fetches every post and filters in JS (slow — kept for benchmarking comparisons).

---
## Architecture

* Controllers handle business logic

* Routes map HTTP requests

* Models define MongoDB schemas

* Middleware validates authentication
---
## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Comment system to make it feel completed
* Pagination for feed(responsive user redirection , enhanced navigation)
* Make text-index search (`SEARCH_MODE=text`) the default once benchmarked further
* User profile analytics
* Custom feed placement for each user
* Better UI for seamless usage
* Open to curiosity and play-around
